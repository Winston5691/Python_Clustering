# Python Clustering
This project is aimed at:

1- How to achieve customer segmentation using machine learning algorithm (KMeans Clustering) in Python in simplest way.

2- Who are your target customers with whom you can start marketing strategy [easy to converse]

3- How the marketing strategy works in real world

This project involves building an algorithm that clusters customers of a shopping mall into different groups. It uses the theory of classification regression problems. It involves customer data, data pre-processing and data analysis. The optmum number of clusters is obtained in data analysis using sum of squares. The K-means algorithom groups the data depending on the algorithm. The cluster of the data has also been visualized.
